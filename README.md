# 🌐 Portfolio Website Clone

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is a **recreation of a portfolio website** using **HTML and CSS**, based on the design provided during the week. We followed the exact layout and styling from the original reference, with the option to use the **Bootstrap** library to enhance responsiveness and consistency.

The goal was to implement clean, semantic HTML structure and modular CSS (or Bootstrap classes) to closely match the portfolio’s design while ensuring the page is responsive on different devices.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Bootstrap 5 (optional - for layout and responsiveness)

---

## 🎯 Solution Approach

- We began by analyzing the structure of the original website and breaking it down into key sections (e.g., header, about, portfolio, contact).
- We used semantic HTML tags to structure content and applied CSS and Bootstrap to style the layout, colors, and responsiveness.
- Bootstrap’s grid system was used to ensure consistent layout and responsive behavior across screen sizes.
- Custom CSS was added where necessary to match specific design details that weren't covered by Bootstrap.
